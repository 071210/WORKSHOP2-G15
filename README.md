# üå± Intelligent Crop Disease Detection System Using Deep Learning  
**Workshop 2 ‚Äî Group 15**  
**Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM)**  

---

## üß† Overview
This project aims to develop an **Intelligent Crop Disease Detection System** using **deep learning**.  
The system enables farmers or agricultural users to **capture or upload leaf images** and instantly detect possible diseases. It provides **disease information and treatment recommendations**, empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions.

The mobile app is built using **Flutter** (for Android/iOS), integrating a **TensorFlow Lite model** trained on the **PlantVillage dataset**.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
1. **Develop a CNN-based model** that can classify crop leaf diseases with high accuracy.  
2. **Design a mobile application interface** for users to capture/upload images and view results.  
3. **Integrate and test the trained deep learning model** in a real-time mobile environment.
